### 1. Analyzing Sales Data
# scenario: You are given a list of sales transactions. Each transaction contains a sales amount in dollars. You need to:
# Use lambda to define small functions.
# Use filter to extract sales above a threshold.
# Use map to apply a discount to all sales.
# Use reduce to compute the total sales amount.
