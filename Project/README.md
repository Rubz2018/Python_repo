### Library-Management-System/
│── library.py       # Core library functionalities
│── book.py          # Book class
│── user.py          # User and Member classes
│── librarian.py     # Librarian class
│── main.py          # Main application
│── database.json    # Data storage

### How OOP is Used in This Project?
✅ Encapsulation → Each class has attributes and methods related to it.
✅ Inheritance → Member and Librarian inherit from User.
✅ Polymorphism → display_info() can be modified for future enhancements.
✅ Abstraction → Library class hides the database handling details.
