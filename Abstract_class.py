# Abstract Class =A class that cannot be installed on it's own; meant to be sub-classed
#                 They can contain abstract methods, which are declared but have no implementation   
#                 Abstracts class benefits:
#                 1. prevent instantiation of hte class itself
#                 2. requires children to use inherited abstract methods
