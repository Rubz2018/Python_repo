# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to " have many form or faces "
#               poly = many
#               mporhe = form 

#       Two ways to achieve Polymorphism
#       1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#       2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes / methods
